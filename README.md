This repo houses items related to a research effort to automate the process of child language development assessment via LLM's. 
In particular, the assessment we are investigating is the Index of Productive Syntax, which scores the presence of 50+ grammatical items. 
There are:
- CHILDES transcripts
- clan-ipsyn scores of those transcripts
- llm-ipsyn scores of those transcripts
- comparisons of these two types of scores
- colab notebooks to carry out llm-ipsyn and score comparison
